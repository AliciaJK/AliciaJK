### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

## A little bit about me...
 Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Cognitive Science graduate from Carleton University in 2019 with a specialization in cognition and psychology and a minor in psychology.

I have a background in aviation with my glider and private pilot license. I recently started on a new endeavour: Swift Drone Academy Inc. We are a small business in the Ottawa area focused on providing focused and fully inclusive Drone training from start to finish. Check us out at SwiftDroneAcademy.ca.
